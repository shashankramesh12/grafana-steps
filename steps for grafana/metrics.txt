1) CPU usage 

Defualt query for cpu usage is:
node_cpu_seconds_total

specify the job name and instance which we want to monitor:
{mode="system",instance="$node",job="$job"}

mode=system takes compelete system cpu usage
mode=idle monitors cpu even when cpu is idle
mode!= idle monitors cpu only when its not idle


apply rate function which gives rate of cpu time rather than just showing how much cpu time there has been since the machine was started:
rate()

irate(): This function gives interval of time over which we wanted to query data points 

to monitor multiple cpu's use avg without(cpu)

The complete query is:
(irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="system",instance="$node",job="$job"}[1m]))

The complete query to monitor multiple cpu is
avg without(cpu) (irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="system",instance="$node",job="$job"}[1m]))


Use {{mode}} in legend text box to moniter all the diffrent types of cpu  usage (system, busy user, busy iowait time, busy other, idle)


2) Memory usage

Defualt query for memory usage is:
node_memory_Memtotal_bytes

To track free memory
node_memory_Memfree_bytes

To track chached memory:
node_memory_cached_bytes

To track buffers:
node_memory_buffers_bytes

To track memory used by kernel
node_memory_SReclaimable_bytes

To track amount of hard drive that is used whenever RAM runs out of memory:
node_memory_SwapTotal_bytes

The complete query for monitoring system memory is:
node_memory_Memtotal_bytes{instance="$node",job="$job"} - node_memory_Memfree_bytes{instance="$node",job="$job"} - node_memory_cached_bytes{instance="$node",job="$job"} - node_memory_buffers_bytes{instance="$node",job="$job"}


Enter 'used' in legend text box to monitor used memory

3)disk space usage

Defualt query for disk usage is
node_filesystem_avail_bytes


we can configure devices which we don't want to track by:
device!~"/dev/loop" (not to track loop file system)
device!~"temp fs | nsfs" (not to track temp file system and name space file system)


To subtract total bytes from avail bytes query is:
node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance="$node",job="$job",device!~"/dev/loop",device!~"temp fs | nsfs"} - node_filesystem_avail_bytes{instance="$node",job="$job"}


4) network traffic monitoring

Defualt query for tracking incoming network traffic is:
node_network_receive_bytes_total

Defualt query for tracking transmited network is:
node_network_transmit_bytes_total 

the complete query fot incoming network traffic is:
node_network_receive_bytes_total{instance="$node",job="$job"} 


the complete query for tracking transmited network is:
node_network_transmit_bytes_total{instance="$node",job="$job"} 


alerting metrics

1) cpu 
sum by (cpu) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!="idle"}[1m]))

2) memory
node_memory_Active_bytes/node_memory_MemTotal_bytes*100

3) disk space
node_filesystem_avail_bytes/node_filesystem_size_bytes*100

4) network
